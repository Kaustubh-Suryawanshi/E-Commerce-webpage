Abstract:
	Because water is an important resource and not all communities around the world can afford to
be liberal with their water needs; it has become important to use available water as efficiently as
possible, especially in agriculture. For the purpose of reducing the overwatering of crops, an
unattended ground moisture sensor can be implemented to measure the current moisture level in
the soil surrounding the plants. This will allow a farmer to know when to water/stop watering
his crop. For convenience, the moisture data information should be transmitted wirelessly to the
user. The design of an unattended ground moisture sensor and wireless communication/user
interface system is discussed. The sensor design consists of a Wheatstone bridge for determining
the resistance of the soil, followed by a differential amplifier for converting the measured
resistance into a voltage. This is done because there exists a correlation between moisture and
resistance. This voltage is interpreted by a microcontroller as moisture data and sent wirelessly to
a Lora communication receiving node by a Lora communication transmitting node. The
receiving node then relays that information to a PC host for access by the user. The system has a
power circuit that consists of a battery and a linear regulator.
